This project is in a stage called illusion now. 
It might be a game about political, ideology war such things. It's more like a Card & Strategy game, so it wouldn't that hard to develop I guess?
The developer, me, has never learned about coding until now, so if someone could give some advice would be awesome.

Starting coding at someday/Nov./2025;

I plan to use c# and unity(if it's involved GUI), and for now divide it to some Classes, then make the whole picture come ture fucntion by function. Point me if I planned it to the wrong direction.
